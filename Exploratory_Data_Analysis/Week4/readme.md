# Week 4 - Project
## Fine particulate matter (PM2.5)


### Questions from Week 4

1. Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008? Using the base plotting system, make a plot showing the total PM2.5 emission from all sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.
  * Total PM2.5 has decreased significantly since 1999 by 53%.
2. Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland (𝚏𝚒𝚙𝚜 == "𝟸𝟺𝟻𝟷𝟶") from 1999 to 2008? Use the base plotting system to make a plot answering this question.
  * Based on the plot, PM2.5 in Baltimore has decreased significantly between 1999 and 2008
3. Of the four types of sources indicated by the 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) variable, which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999–2008 for Baltimore City? Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999–2008? Use the ggplot2 plotting system to make a plot answer this question.
  * Emission of PM2.5 by Non-Road, Nonpoint, and On-Road type has decreased since 1999 but Point type has increased since 1999.
4. Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999–2008?
  * PM2.5 by coal combustion-related sources have decreased significantly since 1999.
5. How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999–2008 in Baltimore City?
  * Since 1999, emission emitted by motor vehicle sources have decreased. But PM2.5 has emissions has increased since 2002. 
6. Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions from motor vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, California (𝚏𝚒𝚙𝚜 == "𝟶𝟼𝟶𝟹𝟽"). Which city has seen greater changes over time in motor vehicle emissions?
  * Although LA county reduced significantly more PM2.5, Baltimore showed the largest percentage difference in reducing PM2.5 emissions since 1999.
